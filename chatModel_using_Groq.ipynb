That being said, here's a general guide to get you started:\n",

            "1. Hyperpigmentation: Dark spots, uneven tone, and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) are common concerns.\n",
            "2. Dryness: Skin of color tends to be drier due to the natural barrier function of melanin, which can lead to dryness, itchiness, and irritation.\n",
            "3. Sensitivity: Darker skin tones can be more reactive to products and ingredients, making sensitivity a common issue.\n",

            "\n",
            "* Exfoliate 1-2 times a week to remove dead skin cells and promote cell turnover. Use a chemical exfoliant containing alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs) or beta-hydroxy acids (BHAs), which are gentler than physical exfoliants.\n",

These skin types tend to have:\\n\\n1. **More melanin**: Higher melanin content can make skin more prone to hyperpigmentation, dark spots, and uneven tone.\\n2. **Thicker skin**: Skin of color often has a thicker epidermis, which can make it more challenging for products to penetrate.\\n3. **Increased sensitivity**: Skin of color can be more reactive to products and environmental stressors, leading to irritation and inflammation.\\n4. **Specific concerns**: Skin of color is more likely to experience conditions like acne, hyperpigmentation, keloid scarring, and skin dryness.\\n\\n**Core Principles for a Skin of Color Skincare Routine:**\\n\\n1. **Gentle, non-irritating products**: Choose products labeled \"fragrance-free\" or \"hypoallergenic\" to minimize the risk of irritation.\\n2. **Moisturize, moisturize, moisturize**: Hydration is crucial for skin of color, as dryness can exacerbate hyperpigmentation and irritation.\\n3. **Sunscreen is essential**: Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30 daily, as darker skin tones are still susceptible to UV damage.\\n4. **Exfoliate carefully**: Gentle exfoliation is necessary to remove dead skin cells and promote cell turnover, but over-exfoliation can lead to irritation and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH).\\n5. **Targeted treatments**: Address specific concerns like acne, hyperpigmentation, or dryness with products containing active ingredients like salicylic acid, vitamin C, or niacinamide.\\n\\n**Sample Skincare Routine for Skin of Color:**\\n\\n**Morning:**\\n\\n1. Cleanse: Use a gentle, non-foaming cleanser (e.g., Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser) to remove dirt and impurities.\\n2. Toner: Apply a toner that balances the skin\\'s pH and helps with hydration (e.g., Thayers Rose Petal Witch Hazel).\\n3. Moisturize: Apply a lightweight, oil-free moisturizer with SPF 30 (e.g., Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel).\\n4. Sunscreen: Apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30 (e.g., La Roche-Posay Anthelios Melt-In Sunscreen Milk).\\n\\n**Night:**\\n\\n1. Cleanse: Use a gentle cleanser (same as morning).\\n2. Exfoliate: 1-2 times a week, use a chemical exfoliant containing alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs) or beta-hydroxy acids (BHAs) (e.g., Paula\\'s Choice 2% BHA Liquid).\\n3. Toner: Apply a toner that helps with skin brightening and hydration (e.g., Pixi Glow Tonic).\\n4. Treatment: Apply a treatment product containing active ingredients like vitamin C, niacinamide, or retinol to address specific concerns (e.g., Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream).\\n5. Moisturize: Apply a rich, hydrating moisturizer to lock in the previous steps (e.g., CeraVe Moisturizing Cream).\\n\\n**Additional Tips:**\\n\\n1. **Be patient**: Skin of color may respond slower to skincare products, so be patient and consistent with your routine.\\n2. **Get enough sleep**: Poor sleep can exacerbate skin concerns like dark circles, puffiness, and hyperpigmentation.\\n3. **Stay hydrated**: Drink plenty of water to help flush out toxins and keep your skin hydrated from the inside out.\\n4. **Consult a dermatologist**: If you have specific skin concerns or questions, consult a dermatologist who specializes in skin of color for personalized guidance.\\n\\nBy following these principles and adapting the sample routine to your individual skin type and concerns, you\\'ll be well on your way to achieving healthy, radiant skin of color!', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 857, 'prompt_tokens': 40, 'total_tokens': 897, 'completion_time': 2.4485714290000002, 'prompt_time': 0.000868971, 'queue_time': 0.058279068999999996, 'total_time': 2.4494404}, 'model_name': 'llama3-70b-8192', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_dd4ae1c591', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-256caa11-060f-4644-83f9-a6c168145e40-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 40, 'output_tokens': 857, 'total_tokens': 897})"

            "3. **Sensitivity**: Skin of color can be more reactive to products, leading to irritation, redness, and inflammation.\n",

            "4. **Use Sunscreen:** Apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 daily, even on cloudy days, to protect your skin from UV damage.\n",
            "5. **Avoid Over-Exfoliating:** Limit exfoliation to 1-2 times a week, as over-exfoliating can lead to irritation, dryness, and increased sensitivity.\n",
            "6. **Stay Hydrated:** Drink plenty of water to keep your skin hydrated from the inside out.\n",
